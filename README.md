# stowaway

**Run programs in a disposable, isolated temporary environment â€“ with macOS filesystem and network sandboxing.**

---

## Features

- Launches any program or shell within a **fresh, temporary HOME directory**.
- Optional **custom temporary directory** location using `--temp-dir`.
- **Sandboxing (macOS only):** Uses [`sandbox-exec`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/sandbox_exec) on macOS with a dynamically generated, deny-by-default profile to provide:
    - **Filesystem Isolation:** Restricts file access, allowing essential system reads and confining writes primarily to the temporary HOME directory.
    - **Optional Network Blocking:** Use `--block-net` to deny outbound network connections.
    - **Path Permissions:** Use `--allow-read <PATH>` and `--allow-write <PATH>` to grant specific permissions to host paths (macOS only).
- Sandboxing features beyond temporary HOME are **not yet implemented** for other operating systems.
- CLI inspired by `cargo` syntax.
- Built with pure Rust.

## Usage

**Important:** On macOS, the sandbox profile is quite strict (`deny default`). While common paths are allowed, complex programs might require additional permissions not yet included or might fail due to sandbox restrictions. Use the `--allow-read` and `--allow-write` flags to grant necessary access.

### Run a command in sandbox

```bash
cargo run -- run [OPTIONS] <program> -- [args...]
```

**Options (macOS only unless specified):**

- `--block-net`: Enforce no outbound network connections.
- `--temp-dir <path>`: Specify a custom path for the temporary directory base (works on all OS).
- `--allow-read <path>`: Allow read access to the specified host path inside the sandbox. Can be used multiple times.
- `--allow-write <path>`: Allow read *and* write access to the specified host path inside the sandbox. Can be used multiple times.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic command (runs in temp HOME)
cargo run -- run ls -- -la

# Block network access
cargo run -- run --block-net curl -- [https://example.com](https://example.com)

# Allow reading a specific file
cargo run -- run --allow-read /path/to/your/file.txt cat -- /path/to/your/file.txt

# Allow writing to a specific directory
cargo run -- run --allow-write /path/to/output_dir touch -- /path/to/output_dir/newfile.txt

# Custom temporary directory
cargo run -- run --temp-dir ./my-sandbox ls -- -la

# Complex command with multiple arguments
cargo run -- run python -- -c "print('hello world')"
```

### Launch an interactive shell

```bash
cargo run -- shell [OPTIONS]
```

**Options (macOS only unless specified):**

- `--block-net`: Disable outbound network connections in the shell.
- `--temp-dir <path>`: Specify a custom path for the temporary directory base (works on all OS).
- `--allow-read <path>`: Allow read access to the specified host path inside the shell.
- `--allow-write <path>`: Allow read/write access to the specified host path inside the shell.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Start shell with network blocking
cargo run -- shell --block-net

# Start shell allowing access to a project directory
cargo run -- shell --allow-write /Users/lj/Projects/my_code
```

**Note**: The `--` separator is required before passing arguments to the `<program>` in the `run` subcommand to prevent them from being interpreted as arguments to `stowaway` itself.

## Limitations (macOS Sandboxing)

- The `deny default` profile is strict and may block legitimate operations needed by complex tools. Discovering all necessary `allow` rules can be challenging.
- Known issues:
    - Running `curl` *without* `--block-net` currently fails due to blocked system interactions needed for DNS resolution (persistent `file-read-metadata` denials for `/etc` and `/var`).
    - Using `--allow-read` for files within certain system directories (like `/tmp`) may not work as expected due to related directory access denials.
- The list of allowed system paths and operations may need further refinement for broader compatibility. Contribution and testing are welcome!

This version updates the features, adds the new flags to the usage examples, and includes a limitations section explaining the current status of the macOS sandbox. You can copy and paste this into your `README.md`.
